## Installation

- Install via `pip install automan`
- We use numpy and matplotlib for our examples

## A toy example

- Trivial example that computes the powers of the integers
- Supports command line arguments

## Best usage recommendations

Your programs should:

1. be configurable using command line arguments

2. generate their output files into a directory specified on the command line

3. save post-processed data into a datafile and not just create plots

## `code/powers.py`

```python
{{< include ../code/powers.py >}}
```

## Explore the code

- Run the example
- Look at the output


## Exercise

- Generate the cube of integers from 0 to 10
- Plot the results in the generated `results.npz`

## Solution

```{python}
import numpy as np
data = np.load('results.npz')

```

## Running the simulations

## Generating output 

## Summary of workflow
